; Hw#4

;1. write a program to input a logical expression built using (at most) the logical connectives and, or, not
;   and to output a logically equivalent expression using (at most) 'and' and not.

;   You need to start an induction definition and an associated datatype for logical expressions.

;2. Read section 1.3.1 in EOPL and solve exercise 1.19

; 1.19: Write a procedure free-vars that takes a list structure representing an expression in
;       the lambda calculus syntax given above and returns a set (a list without duplicates) of all the variables that
;       occur free in the expression. Similarly, write a procedure bound-vars that returns a set of all the
;       variables that occur bound in its argument.

;3. Read section 1.3.2 in EOPL and solve exercise 1.31 and 1.32

; 1.31: 

#lang eopl

; first lets define what our program will do:
; It will accpet an logical expression and output an altered version with only not and 'and' (no or)
; e.g: (not (or A B)) --> (and (not A) (not B))
;      (not (and A B)) --> (or (not A) (not B))
