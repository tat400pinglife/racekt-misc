; quick thing on lexical addresses

; var = (var : depth posiiton)

; where depth is the amount of lambda functions that contains it excluding the one that references it
; position refers to the order the variable appears in the depth of its environment

(lambda (x)
  (lambda (y)
    (
        (lambda (x)
          ((x: 0 0) (y: 1 0)) ; here x is referenced in its environment while y is referenced one environment higher
         )
        
     (x: 1 0)
    )
   )
  )

; each variabel has been replaced with (v: d p) where d is the depth in the environment
; containing v and p is the position of v in that sublist
